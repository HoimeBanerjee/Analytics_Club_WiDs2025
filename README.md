# Analytics_Club_WiDs2025
This repository contains the codes for the analytics club project (Data driven carbon footprint analytics for chemical processes)-IIT Bombay WiDS 2025



For Week 1: 
Task 1: Identifying emission sources for any 3 industrial chemical processes.
1. Cement Production: CaCO3 is heated, breaking down into CaO and CO2
2. Nitric Acid Production: Catalytic oxidation of ammonia
3. Oil and Gas Refining: Burning fossil fuels in furnaces

Task 2: Tha data is from : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/elikplim/eergy-efficiency-dataset

Task 3: Tha data is from : https://github.com/owid/co2-data.

The CO₂ estimation was done for one country from the dataset i.e. Afghanistan using the formula
CO₂ estimation=Fuel Consumption×Emission Factor

For Week 2: 

Task 1: Train 3 models (LR, RF, XGB) to predict CO₂ emissions on any dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saloni1712/co2-emissions

Task 2: Created plots:predicted vs. actual emissions for each country

Task 3: Identify top 5 parameters contributing to carbon intensity using:
Random Forest feature importance : For example: India
